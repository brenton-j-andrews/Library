Delete button desired result:
Once delete button is pressed, "delete mode" is activated. 
"delete mode" remains active until another mouse click occurs not on a HTML card element, or an element is deleted.
While delete mode is active, hovering over any book card elements will change their color. 
Clicking on a card ask the user if they want to delete the card, Yes / No.

Pseudocode upon clicking "delete" button:

activate event listener {
    let cards = all child nodes of library_contents
    for each card, add class name "delete" -> Change card color if mouse hovering.
    let delete_mode = true;

    while (delete_mode) {
        listen for mouse click event.
        if (mouse clicks over card element) {
            prompt delete confirmation {
                if yes {
                    delete html element
                    remove associated book object from myLibrary somehow...
                    call fillLibrary() to update card display / stats.
                }
            }

            delete_mode = false
        } 
        
        else (mouse click occured anywhere else!) {
            delete_mode = false; -> terminate loop.
        }
    }

    remove "delete" class from all card elements;
    return(?);
}
